Don't worry it happens to all of us
You will do it better the next time
Never stop of try
Keep calm and coding
Keep calm and focus
Relax in the next try you will gonna do it
Don't give up
If you keep trying, you will do it
Relax take a break
The coffe could help you
Smile and try again
The man pages could help you, animus
Don't stop, the next time will be
If you can dream it you can do it
Fall seven times and get up eight
Doesn't matter how many times you fall, matter how many times you get up
The triumph of the true woman and man rises from the ashes of error
You must do the things you think you can't do
Failure is success if we learn from it
Winning without risk is succeeding without glory
It's the possibility that keeps the going, not the guarantee
A bad plan is better than no plan
The more difficult the conflict, the more glorious the triumph
The only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude
Life contracts or expands in proportion to the courage shown
Learning is a gift. Even when pain is your teacher
Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier
Don't worry about failures, worry about the chances you lose when you don't even try
Only in the dark can you see the stars
When you have a dream you have to grab it and never let it go
If victory is difficult, the happiness of winning is greater
Failure is the seasoning that flavors success
Do not judge every day by the harvest you have obtained, rather by the seeds you have planted
A person can be successful in almost anything for which he has unlimited enthusiasm
The trick is which one emphasizes. We can make ourselves miserable, or we can make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same
Is precisely the possibility of realizing a dream that makes life interesting
